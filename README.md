# Object Localization

This project was done as a part of a Hackathon hosted by Flipkart, by the name Flipkart GRID Challenge - _Teach the Machines_ (powered by Dare2Complete).

As the name suggests, the goal was to put a bounding box around the object in the image.

We were provided with around 14000 _640x480x3_ coloured training images (each image had one object) and labels corresponding to each image. (_labels were the __x,y__ coordinates of the __top-left__ and __bottom-right__ corners of the box_)

We were supposed to maximize the IOU (_intersection over union_) of our predicted bounding box. We were able to push that number (_IOU_) upto 0.83.

Competition was from _Feb, 2019_ to _March, 2019_. My friend @pandeydivyank (Divyank Pandey) was in it with me.

So I thought of uploading our work and maybe making it a little more reproducible.
